    <h1>Recipe Page</h1>
    <p>Moving on to the second HTML project for beginners in our list,let's build a recipe page</p>

    <p>I really like this because it's a solid introduction to new concepts for beginners,including some HTML5 semantic
        tags</p>

    <p>By building thsi HTML project ,you can except to improve your skills in the following areas:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="list_f">Working with lists:</li> Creating ordered(numered) and unorderd(bulletd) lists to display
        ingredients and steps.
        <li class="list_f">Styling List:</li>Changing list styles and using images as list items.
        <li class="list_f">Embeded images:</li>Using images to make content more visually appealing.
        <li class="list_f">The CSS Model Box</li> Manipulating padding,borders,and margins to adjust layout.

        <!-- <li><span style="color:red">Styling List:</span>Changing list styles and using images as list items</li>
    </ul> -->


        <p>
            If you're still new to web development, this is a great way to level up your foundational skills. It's also
            a
            great idea to tackle this afier project#1,
            it's a nice follow-on from the skills you need for the personal bio page.
        </p>

        By tackling this project, you will get some hands-on experience with:
        <ul>
            <li> Using <b>header</b> and <span style="color:red;">footer </span>tags for a semantic HTMLS structure.
            </li>
            <li> Utilizing <b>section </b>elements to semantically group content.</li>
            <li> Create a list of ingredients with an unordered list and thel lag.</li>
            <li> Outline the recipe steps with an ordered list and the 01 tag.</li>
            <li> Embed an image to showcase the final product.</li>
            <li> Apply various CSS styles to adjust the layout with padding and margins, and improve
                typography by changing the font Eunily and colors,</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            like this <span style="background-color:red;border:2px solid black; font-weight:bold;"> HTML Project</span>
            ,as
            it's fun and enginng way to rainforce the skills you<br>
            picked up in the first project while adding more elements and styles to your growing toolkit.</p>
        <p>
            it's also a really practical exercise because displaying lists and images in a user-friendly format is<br>
            a common task in web development.
